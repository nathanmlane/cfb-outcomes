# In CFB should you bet the Over or Under?
This project utilizes data from the 2015 college football season to determine whether there is a blind bet on the Over/Under that would provide a statistically significant improved chance of winning. To do this I utilized SQL, Python and several of its libraries. 

## Dependencies
In order to run this program you need to have the following programs, languages, and libraries installed:
  * Anaconda | https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
  * Python | https://www.python.org/downloads/
  * Jupyter Notebook | https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
  * Pandas | https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html
  * Plotly | https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/
  * Calendar
  * SQLite3
  
Once everything is properly installed, enter the [jupyter notebook] command in your Terminal/Console to initiate the notebook, then proceed to choose the cfb_outcomes folder and from there the cfb_predict.ipynb file. Once in the notebook, restart the kernel and run all cells. 

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or troubles.
